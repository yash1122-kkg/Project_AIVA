# Welcome
## Project : Admission Inquiry Voice Assistant (AIVA)

## Problem Statement:  
For parents who want complete and institution-specific information, navigating the 
college admissions process for a particular educational institution might present
serious problems. Current tools sometimes don't provide customized advice, which
leaves parents perplexed and unsure about the requirements for admission, program
requirements, deadlines, and other important information that affects their child's
acceptance.
The difference emphasizes the need for a specialist tool such as the Admission
Inquiry Voice Assistant (AIVA), which seeks to give parents the tools they need to
navigate their child's admissions process to a particular educational institution by
offering accurate, thorough, and customized guidance.

Other Use cases: 

1. It can be used in other industries/institutes as well, just upload your organization's document into the code then you are good to go!
2. Helps individuals to get to know the organizations quickly.
